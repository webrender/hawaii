Route yourself to Tantalus drive and Kolonahe Place for the full drive. **NOTE: As of April 2022, a landslide has blocked through-access of the drive.  You will need to access Round Top drive from the other direction to reach the Tantalus lookout.** Stops on the drive:
                    * NƒÅ Ala Hele Trails: Large network of trails on and around Tantalus drive. Something for every hiker, from 30min walks to full-day hikes. [View trail map.](./assets/img/tantalustrailmap.jpg){:target="_blank"}

                    * 100 Sails: In our opinion, the best buffet experience in Hawaii, along with great sunset views.  Located on the 2nd floor.

                    A 30 minute hike which offers panoramic views of the ocean and Waimanalo Bay. Great spot for whale-watching! Paved trail, but no shade so another spot recommended earlier in the day. Not recommended for dogs for this reason. There are two detours you can take along the trail:
                    * Alan Davis Beach: A secluded beach with a great cliff jump into the ocean. The trail is well marked but the beach is relatively secluded for this part of Oahu.
                    * Makapu'u Tidepools: Beautiful tidepools are located down a steep cliff a short distance off the trail. WARNING: Bring water and a hat for this trek.  In addition, be aware of your surroundings at the tidepools - large and sudden waves have injured and even drowned visitors to this location. Please watch videos before considering this stop, it is not for the faint of heart.

                description: |
                    I'll start by saying that I have not included this attraction on my guide in the past; however, many people *do* enjoy their time at the PCC so I feel like it should be included.  The Polynesian Cultural center offers a full day's worth of attractions that will allow visitors to learn more and partake in cultural experiences which represent several different Polynesian cultures.  There is also a luau which is the largest on the island.
                    
                    That being said - the PCC is owned and operated by the LDS (Mormon) Church and the experiences, while entertaining, do not touch on the colonist history and struggle of these peoples. IMO this is a great place to visit if you're looking for a "Polynesian Disneyland" - if you are interested in the history of Polynesian culture, I strongly recommend a guided tour of Iolani Palace, an authentic Native Hawaiian-run luau such as Toa or Nutridge, and volunteering on the island in activities that benefit Native Hawaiians, such as the restoration of Hawaiian fishponds. If you *do* visit the PCC, be aware that the "free tram tour" is a thinly-veiled advertisement for the LDS and Brigham Young University, located next door.

                    First things first: The Dole Plantation is on this guide mainly so that I can tell you that it is a tourist trap. There is a train ride that tells you about the history of growing pineapples in Hawaii.  There is a gift shop with pretty much any pineapple-themed item you could imagine.  There is a garden with some actual pineapples.  There is a food court with mediocre food and Dole Whip (which is available at several other places on the island.) If you are traveling through Central Oahu and you *really love pineapples*, or you have children that would enjoy the train ride, this may be worth a stop. If you are looking to explore the beauty and wonder of Hawaii, this is not worth the time spent, especially if you are traveling out of the way to get here.

                description: The only active historical railroad on Oahu (Dole Plantation doesn't count).  The railroad broke ground in 1889 and was in commercial and military use until 1970, when it was added to the national register of historic places.  The HRS provides train rides on Wed/Sat/Sun. which go through the towns of Kapolei and Ko'Olina.  Great fun for kids or any railroad fans.
